<h2>🍪 What is Cookiebox?</h2>
<p>
    Cookiebox is your trusted companion for discovering the finest cookies around! 
    We taste, test, and review cookies from various stores, rating them especially on their <strong>milk-dipping quality</strong>.
    Whether you love a crispy dunk or a chewy bite, Cookiebox helps you find your next favorite.
</p>

<h2>🍪 Our Mission</h2>
<p>
    Our goal is to make your cookie shopping easier, tastier, and a little bit more fun.
    We believe no cookie should be judged without a proper milk test — that's why every cookie we showcase comes with a detailed <strong>Dip Quality Rating</strong>.
    Cookies are meant to be enjoyed — and we’re here to guide you to the best!
</p>

<h2>🍪 How We Rate Cookies</h2>
<p>
    Every cookie is judged on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flavor</strong> — How delicious it is at first bite.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture</strong> — Crispy, chewy, crumbly... the perfect mouthfeel.</li>
    <li><strong>Dunk Performance</strong> — Does it survive the milk dunk like a champion?</li>
    <li><strong>Overall Satisfaction</strong> — How happy it makes you!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Our unique <strong>Dip Quality Rating</strong> (0.5–5 scale) focuses on how well a cookie handles a good dunk in cold milk — because dunking should make a cookie even better, not ruin it!
</p>

<h2>🍪 Where to Buy</h2>
<p>
    We’re not a store ourselves — we highlight where you can find these amazing cookies.
    You’ll find the shop name listed with each cookie. Support your local stores and discover hidden gems!
